Guidelines for Verb Masking 

These guidelines determine the process through which we decide which token in a given sentence we mask. Our goal is to mask the verb which best reflects the relationship between the nouns marked in a specific semantic relation. The sentences are all derived from the SemEval 2010 - Task 8 Data Set. Examples will be provided for ambiguous sentences. 

Case (1): There is one verb in the sentence. The only existing verb will be masked.
Example: 
1998	"Public education systems have carried <e1>nations</e1> into <e2>prosperity</e2>."
1998	"Public education systems have [MASK] nations into prosperity."

Case (2): There is more than one verb in the sentence. The verb that most closely approximates the semantic relation between e1 and e2 will be masked. 
Example:
1987	"In view of the terrible <e1>destruction</e1> that was caused by the flood <e2>waves</e2>, we have to fear that a number of Germans, clearly in the three-digit numbers, will be among the dead."
1987	"In view of the terrible destruction that was [MASK] by the flood waves, we have to fear that a number of Germans, clearly in the three-digit numbers, will be among the dead."

Case (3): There is more than one verb in the sentence, but none of the verbs approximate the semantic relation between e1 and  e2. The verb that is syntactically (according to the F-scheme) closest to e1 and e2 will be masked.
Example:
1979	"Little did these naive people realize at the time that they were embracing a foul <e1>brood</e1> of ungrateful <e2>vipers</e2>, which would soon prove to be their undoing."
1979	"Little did these naive people realize at the time that they were [MASK] a foul brood of ungrateful vipers, which would soon prove to be their undoing."

Case (4): There is no verb in the sentence. If there is a nominalised verb, the nominalised verb will be masked. Otherwise, the sentence will be restructured to find a verb connecting e1 and e2.If that is not possible, nothing will be masked.
Example: 
1933	"Body piercing jewellery specially for <e1>lobe</e1> <e2>ear</e2> piercings."
1933	"Body [MASK] jewellery specially for lobe ear piercings."
